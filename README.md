# Sorcery

**Sorcery** is a desktop and web-based tool to **visualize**, **edit**, and **enrich** metadata files in `.gen.{json,yaml,md}` format.

It helps teams explore their enterprise architecture, workflows, and documentation — all powered by Git.

---

## What is Sorcery?

Sorcery is a **visual interface** for `.gen` metadata, designed to make complex systems understandable and navigable.

It enables:

- 📁 **Multi-repo visualization**: Load `.gen` files from multiple Git repositories
- 📊 **Live log streaming**: View real-time logs and system events
- ✍️ **Metadata editing**: Modify `.gen` files directly in the UI
- 🧠 **Context enrichment**: Add flows, documentation, and cross-linked references

> Sorcery turns your metadata into a living map of your enterprise.

## Flexible Modeling

Unlike rigid models, Sorcery supports **freeform schemas** with:

- Infinite nesting levels
- Cross-cutting views (dev, architecture, org charts, functional tickets…)
- Custom visual layers and semantic links


---

## Use cases

- Visualize architecture from `.gen.yaml` files
- Link Jira tickets to system components
- Enrich org charts with documentation
- Explore flows across design, dev, and ops
- Edit metadata collaboratively via Git
